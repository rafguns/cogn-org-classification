# A comparison of cognitive and organizational classification

This repository is an accompaniment to the paper 'A comparison of cognitive and organizational classification of publications in the
Social Sciences and Humanities'.

In the paper, we study the discrepancy between two ways of classifying publications in the social sciences and humanities (SSH): on the basis of the contents of publications and publication channels (cognitive classification) or on the basis of the organizational structure of departments, faculties etc. (organizational classification). Using data for the period 2000-2015 from 76,076 publications (co-)authored by SSH researchers affiliated to a Flemish university, we compare the organizational classification of the publications with a cognitive classification based on OECD Fields Of Science. In all fields except one, the cognitive discipline with the most publications is the one that most closely matches the organizational discipline, although there are substantial differences between disciplines in terms of overlap and concentration. Our study shows that it is quite common for researchers affiliated to an organizational unit to also carry out research in other domains.
